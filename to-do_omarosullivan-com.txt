In the Sunrise over Wicklow portfolio page... there are labels "Oil" and "Landscape" but I can't edit them in the CMS - make a way to manage these labels

In the CMS page if I edit something but then click Cancel the modal remains - close the modal when the user clicks cancel

How do I Edit the Name of the Website in the CMS Admin?

On the lion page... the image just disppeared and I had to upload it again - make sure that doesn't happen again
