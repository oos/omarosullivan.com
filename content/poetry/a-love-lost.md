A moment in time drew you forth.
Seeds of life swirling within. Good since before time began.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Forged for an eternity.
This journey may not have been your first. Truths known early others fail to learn in a lifetime.
Have you traversed the path of descent more than once?
An ancient one. Surely Wisdom bestowed treasures while the others slept.

Deep calls unto deep wounds.
A depth of mystery.
And breadth.
Inhale the beauty, the pain, the injustice and love.
Exhale the joy, the anger, the bitterness and forgiveness.
Inhale a deep breath of glorious cruelty and grace.
Exhale love and fear.
In and out; hovering over the formless, now permeating all form.
Death merely alters. From beauty to splendour.
Another journey my darling.

Lightning struck twice. Thrice bitten. Not shy to love.
To be made lie down in damp and cold pastures.
Peace in pain.
Content in calamity.
Forgiveness in futility.
Your true colours shone through. Beautiful.
Tragedy tried and tragedy failed.
You lost, yet won.
Love won.
Hope won.

Your strength revealed in weakness.
The upward path descended.
Loss birthed gain.
Your sacrifices pay dividends.
Receive the return.
Return to Source.
In peace.
In pieces. Fragments restored.
Whole again.
Again.

A life lived,
A life loved,
A love lost,
A loss gained,
A gain paid forth.
